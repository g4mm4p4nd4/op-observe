"""Open Observability instrumentation helpers.

This package provides lightweight OpenTelemetry-inspired primitives
as well as decorators that mimic the behaviour of OpenLLMetry and
OpenInference integrations for LangChain and LangGraph based agent
applications. The goal is to expose an ergonomic API that can be used
without external dependencies while still emitting rich span metadata
for testing purposes.
